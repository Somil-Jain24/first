            Aditi,  
            Do you ever stop and wonder how magical it is that we met?  
            Of all the people, of all the places, of all the moments…  
            It was **you and me**, right there, at the perfect time.  
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The way you smile, the way you laugh, the way you just **exist**—  
            it makes my world brighter. 🌟  
            You are more than just a person to me. You are my **favorite person**. 💖
        </p>

        <p class="zoom-in">If I had to choose all over again, I’d still choose you. Every. Single. Time. 💙</p>
