        <p class="fade-in">
            You know that feeling when time slows down?  
            When a moment stretches endlessly, as if the universe is telling you,  
            "Hey, pay attention, this is important"?  
            That’s exactly how I felt when we met for the first time.
        </p>

        <p class="slide-in">
            I remember your smile. The way your eyes sparkled when you talked.  
            The way our conversation felt easy, effortless, like we'd known each other forever.  
        </p>

        <p class="zoom-in">
            That moment changed everything.  
            And here we are today, looking back at it with a smile.  
            That first meeting? It wasn’t just a meeting.  
            It was the start of something beautiful.
